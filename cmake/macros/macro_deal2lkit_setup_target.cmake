# This file implements the D2K_SETUP_TARGET macro, which is
# part of the deal.II library.
#
# Usage:
#       D2K_SETUP_TARGET(target)
#       D2K_SETUP_TARGET(target DEBUG|RELEASE)
#
# This appends necessary include directories, linker flags, compile flags
# and compile definitions and the deal.II library link interface to the
# given target. In particular:
#
# INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES is appended with
#   "${D2K_INCLUDE_DIRS}"
#
# COMPILE_FLAGS is appended with
#   "${D2K_CXX_FLAGS} ${D2K_CXX_FLAGS_<build type>}"
#
# LINK_FLAGS is appended with
#   "${D2K_LINKER_FLAGS ${D2K_LINKER_FLAGS_<build type>}"
#
# COMPILE_DEFINITIONS is appended with
#   "${D2K_USER_DEFINITIONS};${D2K_USER_DEFINITIONS_<build type>}"
#
# If no "DEBUG" or "RELEASE" keyword is specified after the target, the
# current CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE determines which compiler and linker flags as
# well as compile definitions to use and against which deal.II library it
# should be linked against.
#
# If the requested build type is not available (e.g. DEBUG request but
# deal.II was compiled with release mode only), the other available will be
# used instead.
#
